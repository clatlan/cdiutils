My python package to help X-ray Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) practitioners in their analysis and visualisation workflows. I developed the package during my PhD.

The package is designed to handle the three primary stages of a BCDI data processing workflow:

* **Pre-processing** (data centering and cropping)
* **Phase retrieval**: utilises  PyNX for accurate phasing (refer to [PyNX documentation](https://pynx.esrf.fr/en/latest/)).
* **Post-processing** (orthogonalisation, phase manipulation, strain computation etc.)

It is assumed that the phase retrieval is conducted using the PyNX package. The `BcdiPipeline` class runs all three stages and can manage connections to different machines, especially for GPU-based phase retrieval.

Some features of this package include:

* **Flexibility in Hardware:** While the phase retrieval stage may leverage GPUs, pre- and post-processing can be executed without GPU support.
* **Utility Functions:** The package provides utility functions to analyse processed data and generate plots suitable for potential publications.

## Installation

### Using pip (from PyPI - recommended)

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install cdiutils
```

### Using conda (recommended for development)

Create a new conda environment with all dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository first
git clone https://github.com/clatlan/cdiutils.git
cd cdiutils

# Create conda environment from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate cdiutils

# Install cdiutils in development mode
pip install -e .
```

For development (includes documentation and testing tools):

```bash
# Create development environment
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate cdiutils-dev
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip (from GitHub - development version)

You can also install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

You can install the package directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/clatlan/cdiutils.git
```

To update your environment with the latest commits:

```bash
pip install -I --no-deps git+https://github.com/clatlan/cdiutils.git
```

_Note: Check out the dev branch for the latest features and bug fixes. The dev branch is not guaranteed to be stable._

Upgrade your environment with a new version of the package:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/clatlan/cdiutils.git
```

## Getting started

Once the package is installed, you can try it right away using the notebook template directly accessible with the command:

```bash
prepare_bcdi_notebook [path_to_destination]
```

This will generate a notebook template at the given destination.

## Processing BCDI data

Once data are processed, the `BcdiPipeline` instance saves the data in .npz, .cxi and .vti files following the CXI file format convention (see [https://www.cxidb.org/cxi.html]()). It also plots summary and debug figures such as:

* **Summary Slice Plot**

* **Isosurface determination**

* **Different strain computation methods**

## BCDI reconstruction analysis
If want to analyse and compare your reconstructions, check out the example notebook [bcdi_reconstruction_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/clatlan/cdiutils/blob/master/examples/bcdi_reconstruction_analysis.ipynb) in the `examples` folder. This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis process, including:
* **Slice plots of any quantity you like (here phase) across different conditions:**

* **Reciprocal space plots in the orthogonal frame (lab frame)**

* **Histogram plots of any quantity you like across different conditions:**

## Cross section quiver
The cross section quiver is nice tool for visualising the strain and displacement fields and their relationship in BCDI data. 

* The cross section quiver allows to plot cross section of strain and displacement field on the same plot.
